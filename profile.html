      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio. I’m a passionate software engineer based in Los
        Angeles, CA. With a unique journey from psychology to the forefront of
        technology, I am thrilled at the prospect of joining the tech field as
        an iOS developer. My passion lies in leveraging my nontraditional
        background and newfound technical skills to create inclusive,
        user-centric solutions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blue">Diverse Pathway Into Tech</h2>

      <p>
        My pivot to technology began with a transformative 14-week course with
        Code First Girls, an organization dedicated to closing the gender gap in
        tech through free education. There, I embraced the mission to bridge the
        gender gap in technology, gaining not just technical skills but also a
        deep commitment to inclusivity and empowerment in the tech industry.
        This journey has equipped me with a versatile array of skills (including
        but not limited to):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Swift</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Currently I’ve enrolled into DevMountain, a bootcamp to solidify the
        skills I’ve gained and foster new technical expertise, such a gaining a
        specialization in iOS development.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blue">Creative Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        Creatively, my freelance experience in creating compelling YouTube
        thumbnails has honed my ability to engage users and tell stories
        visually. In my six months as a thumbnail artist I have:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Increased</b> Fuzzins' subscriber base by <b>45%</b> to 48.9k
          subscribers and contributed to a <b>3.5%</b> increase in Alipop's
          subscribers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This achievement highlights my ability to understand and influence user
        engagement, a key skill in developing user-centric software solutions.
        My skills are not just tools; they are the means through which I create
        meaningful and impactful user experiences.
